A. Core Data and IdentityFeatureDesign Detail (Proposal)Rationale1. Identity LinkStores local subset of user data (username, profile_picture_url, bio).Performance: Storing this data locally prevents the Social-Tech service from making slow, remote calls to the SSO Microservice just to render every post in the feed.2. Core Data FieldsOwned Data: post_content, like_count, comment_threads, follower_list, product_review_ratings.This unique, high-volume data is the lifeblood of the community and must be owned by this service.3. User Content StorageAWS S3: Uses a dedicated S3 bucket to store raw user uploads (images/videos). The Social-Tech service stores only the secure S3 path/URL in its database.Scaling: Offloads massive file storage and delivery to a specialized cloud service (S3/CloudFront).

B. Feed and Content LogicFeatureDesign Detail (Proposal)Rationale4. Content Feed SourceChronological Stream + Analytics Ranking.Hybrid Approach: For starters, the feed is mostly chronological. It calls the Analytics Microservice for input (e.g., "Show me posts with high recent engagement") to apply a basic ranking algorithm.5. Rating SystemRead API: Exposes GET /v1/ratings/product-summary/{sku}.The Social-Tech service owns the Ratings Data and exposes a simple API that the Marketplace Microservice calls to display stars/review counts on product pages.

C. Communication and IntegrationFeatureDesign Detail (Proposal)Rationale6. Notifications TriggerAPI Call to Email Microservice: POST /v1/notify/emailThe Social-Tech service formats the notification request ("New Like on Post ID 123") and sends it directly to the dedicated Email Microservice for delivery.7. Data Filtering (Profile Privacy)Local Authorization Check: When serving a profile, the service checks its local data: if the requested profile's setting is private and the viewer is not on the follower_list, the service hides the content.Enforces privacy rules instantly without making cross-service calls.8. Fantasy Sports LinkSocial Data API: GET /v1/user/{id}/social-statusThe Fantasy Sports Microservice calls this API to pull simple required data (e.g., "Is user active?") or push Fantasy event updates to the user's social stream.
