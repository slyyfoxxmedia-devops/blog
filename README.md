A. Core Data Consumption
Content Source: What specific API endpoint on the CMS Microservice does the Blog call to retrieve the articles, images, and author profiles for public display?

Display Format: Does the Blog Microservice process and render the raw content (HTML/text blocks) locally, or does the CMS provide pre-rendered HTML ready for display?

Search Integration: How does the Blog Microservice leverage the dedicated Search Microservice to provide blog-specific search results?

B. User Interaction and EngagementAuthor Identity: When the Blog displays an author's name, where does it get the author's primary profile data (name, picture, bio) from?Commenting System: Will the Blog implement its own commenting system, or will it integrate with the Social-Tech Microservice to handle all user comments and interactions?Subscription Gate: How does the Blog Microservice ensure that only users with a valid Pro or Elite tier status can access premium, gated articles?C. Performance and SEOSpeed Strategy: Since the Blog is crucial for SEO, what is the primary architectural strategy for ensuring the fastest load time?Internal Linking: How does the Blog Microservice retrieve relevant, related product links to suggest to the reader?Blog Microservice Blueprint (Finalized)The Blog Microservice (blog.slyyfoxxmedia.com) is a high-traffic, content-display application designed for SEO and user engagement. It acts primarily as a reader and renderer of content and social data.A. Core Data ConsumptionFeatureDesign Detail (Proposal)Rationale1. Content SourceGET /v1/content/articles/live (from CMS Microservice)Content Integrity: Ensures the Blog only displays published, structured articles and not drafts or unapproved content.2. Display FormatLocal Processing/Rendering. The Blog Microservice retrieves raw text/content blocks and uses its own local HTML templates to style and render the final page.Speed & SEO: This approach allows for Server-Side Rendering (SSR), which is critical for search engine optimization (SEO) and fast initial page load times.3. Search IntegrationAPI Call to Search Microservice. The Blog's internal search bar calls the dedicated Search Microservice API: GET /v1/search/query?q={term}&type=article.Specialization: Delegates all high-volume, complex search indexing and query processing to the specialized Search service.B. User Interaction and EngagementFeatureDesign Detail (Proposal)Rationale4. Author IdentityAPI Call to Social-Tech Microservice. The Blog calls the Social-Tech API: GET /v1/profiles/public/{user_id}.Identity Hub: The Social-Tech service owns all public user profile data, ensuring the Blog displays the most current name, photo, and bio.5. Commenting SystemIntegrate with Social-Tech. The Blog embeds the Social-Tech Microservice's UI component (e.g., an iframe or a micro-frontend) to handle all comments.Consolidation: Avoids building and maintaining a separate database and moderation system for comments; the Social-Tech service handles all user interaction logic.6. Subscription GateJWT Token Check. The Blog reads the subscription_tier claim from the user's SSO Token (JWT).Decentralized Authorization: If the tier is below "Pro," the Blog's code hides the premium article content and displays a "Subscribe to Read More" prompt.C. Performance and SEOFeatureDesign Detail (Proposal)Rationale7. Speed StrategyServer-Side Rendering (SSR) + CloudFront Caching. The Blog renders the page on the server for SEO, and the final HTML is then aggressively cached by CloudFront (CDN).Optimal Speed: Provides search engines with static HTML (best for ranking) and minimizes load on the CMS and Blog servers.8. Internal LinkingAPI Call to Product Microservice. The Blog calls the Product Microservice: GET /v1/products/related-by-tag/{article_tag}.Conversion: Directly links high-traffic content to commercial products, driving user conversion from the Blog to the Marketplace.
